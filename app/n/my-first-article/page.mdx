# my first article

## intro

you can write your content here using standard Markdown syntax. Some examples:

- **Bold text** and _italic text_
- [Links to other pages](/work)
- Lists and bullet points

## Code Examples

```js
// You can include code blocks
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Using Components

Since this is MDX, you can also use React components directly in your markdown:

import { NameTransition } from "@/app/components/NameTransition";

<NameTransition />{" "}
