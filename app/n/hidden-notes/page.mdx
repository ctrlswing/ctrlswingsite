# hidden notes

<Tags tags={metadata.tags} className="mt-2 mb-8" />

nobody told me about the secret notes.

they live between the frets. ghostly harmonics hiding at sacred spots along the string. they live between the frets. harmonics hiding at sacred spots along the string. touch them with a light finger and they sing. different from their fretted cousins.

this is how we learn: 
part instruction manual, part treasure map.
the manual tells you where to press. 
the map leads you to discover what's hidden.

learning is a duet between knowledge and play. structured practice gives you the foundation. curiosity shows you the spaces between.
