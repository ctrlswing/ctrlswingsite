# the next note

<Tags tags={metadata.tags} className="mt-2 mb-8" />


i spent weeks chasing perfect guitar dynamics. loudest possible to softest possible. stuck on absolutes.

until i learned to listen for the next note. each touch a whisper quieter than the last. each stroke a breath stronger than before.

miles davis knew. when his band hit wrong notes, he'd weave them into right ones. no absolutes in jazz. only moments to build from.

progress lives in the space between now and next. absolutes exist in minds. reality flows note to note, moment to moment.
